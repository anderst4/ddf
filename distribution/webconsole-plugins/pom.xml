        This is a simple backport of the plugins from the Apache Karaf 2.3.x
        tree into the 2.3.1 tagged tree. The source files are copied as is
        from the 2.3.x tree and built here to be included in the DDF distribution
        based on the 2.3.1 branch. These fixes were implemented as part of the
        fix for KARAF-2285 and placed into the 2.3.2, 2.4.0, and 3.0.0 branches.
        This module should be removed on the next upgrade to Karaf version
        (greater than 2.3.1). Since this code is copied directly as is from the
        future versions of Karaf, the license is left as is.
