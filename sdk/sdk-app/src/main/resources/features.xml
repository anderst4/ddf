        Should rarely, if ever, need to change rrdDataSourceName from "data".
        
        rrdPath should be a descriptive name of what metric is being collected and always
        end with the .rrd file extension.
        
        rrdDataSourceType can only be COUNTER or GAUGE. COUNTER is for metrics that
        always increment (e.g., query count). GAUGE is for metrics that can wax and wane,
        e.g., response time.
