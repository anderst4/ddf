    Do not want these JMX Collectors to be edited by end user, but latest Apache Felix updates
    now display *all* managed service [factories] whether they have a metatype.xml file or not.
    So this metatype.xml file allows the configuration popup to be displayed (vs. an error), but
    displays no fields that can be edited.
    
    Furthermore, the "~" in front of the name forces this managed service factory to be displayed
    last (in lexicographical order) on the Configurations tab of web admin console.
